1. Google Search: Basic Google Search copy 

2. Image Search: Copy of Google's Image Search. The key to solving 
this is having a hidden input with name="tbm" and value="isch". This
tells the browser that the search we are querying should return images.

3. Advanced Search: Coppy of Google's Advanced Search page. The user
should be provided with the following four fields:
a) Find pages with... "all these words:"
b) Find pages with... "this exact word or phrase:"
c) Find pages with... "any of these words:"
d) Find pages with... "none of these words:"
Conditions: The page should be consistent with Google's CSS for
Advanced Search (aka button should be blue with white text) and
clicking the button should return the results page for the given query.
